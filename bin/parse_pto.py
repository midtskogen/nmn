# This module implements scanning of pto files. The scan is merely syntactic,
# meaning that (hopefully) all the various abbreviation letters are processed,
# but their meaning is ignored. Whether this approach is sufficient, remains
# to be seen - the advantage is relative ease of the scanning process.
# In the original pto documentation there are quite clear guidelines on
# what lines are what. If the line starts with a character from a defined
# character set, it is a meaningful line, everything else is ignored.
# By default, may parser is more liberal: If the line starts with any
# alphabetic character, it is considered meaningful. This allows for the
# parser to still work if new line types are added. As long as the data
# in the lines aren't structured differently than those in other lines,
# the scan will still succeed.
# A complication is added by various extensions to the original syntax.
# These usually come in the guise of comment lines - they start with a '#'
# character, and will be ignored by 'orhodox' pto syntax. But of course, they
# are meaningful. So I've made an effort to cater for what I call the
# 'ugly ducklings' and process them in a way that makes them accessible
# in an obvious way.
# I have also allowed for individual entries in lines to have
# any letter as prefix. There are some entry types which are preceded
# by multi-letter field qualifiers. This is regrettable, because it spoils
# the syntax which is, otherwise, quite clean. I have tried to accomodate
# all multi-character field type qualifiers - I can't be sure I know
# them all. If new multi-letter fields are introduced, the regular expressions
# of the scanner will have to be amended - this is luckily a trivial task.
# New single-letter field qualifiers will be accepted straight away.
# I've also made an effort to provide ample comments throughout the script.
# Things are explained in the order thay are implemented, it may be instructive
# to once read through the lot ;-)

# will be accepted as line headers.

# as best as I could figure it out from the scanty documentation; if there
# should be any errors they can easily be rectified by editing the sub-RE for
# the group member_qualifier, right in the beginning of the pto member RE.
# So this RE refers to members of 'proper' pto lines, like p-, c-, i-, etc. lines,
# and the assumption is that any newly introduced lines will use similar mechanisms
# to notate their data, i.e. by preceding the data field by a one-letter qualifier.

# now for the data types for the result of the scan of the pto lines:

# topmost is class pto_scan. This performs and contains the scan of a whole
# pto file. The scan is kept in a member variable 'sequential', which retains the
# same order as the input lines, but instead of mere text, each line is represented
# by a pto_line object which, in case of content-bearing lines, has information
# about the content of the line:
# the actual text found in the pto file, and a breakdown of it's content into a
# structured format so that individual data fields become easily accessible.
# The pto_scan object is created by passing it a pto file name.
# In a pto_scan object, you'll find these members:
#
# filename              - name of the pto file that was processed
# accepted_line_headers - set of characters that were accepted as line headers
# sequential            - list of internal representations of the file's
#                         lines; these are objects of type pto_line, see below
#
# further, optionally, if 'make_member_access()' was used:
#
# a member for every type of line that occured. These members
# are accessed by the appropriate letter, so if we have a pto_scan
# object by the name of s, access is by s.i (images), s.c (control points)
# etc., and will yield a list of pto_line objects of that type, so simplified
# access syntax along the lines of s.i[7] (the seventh i-line) is possible
